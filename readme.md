#jhds-gcd

Course project repo for the Johns Hopkins' Getting and Cleaning Data course, part of the Data Science Specialization at Coursera.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal was to prepare tidy data to be used for later analysis.

### Files

The project contains 3 files:

* `readme.md` this file
* `codebook.md` document describing the variables, the data, and cleanup transformations
* `run_analysis.R` the script


### Source data

The data came from the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

See `codebook.md` for details.


### Script

The `run_analysis.R` script downloads and extracts the data, performs the analysis required in the project and outputs a file named `uci_har_means_tidy.txt`.

To run the script, copy the file `run_analysis.R` to a directory of your choosing, configure the working directory in the script and then run

    source("run_analysis.R")


### Requirements

* R, with packages *dplyr* and *reshape2* installed.
* RStudio (optional)

The script was tested on Linux Mint 17.1 x64, running R version 3.2.2.
